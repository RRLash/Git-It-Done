# [overpass turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu)   

Overpass turbo is fantastic way to query and export just the data you want from OSM.  The following is an example I used when I wanted to export parking lots and parking spaces in my neighborhood.

The first query was constructed by using the Wizard tool, where I entered the parking lot tag, which is amenity=parking

```

The original search was:
“amenity=parking”
-->
<osm-script output="json" timeout="25">
  <!-- gather results -->
  <union>
    <!-- query part for: “amenity=parking” -->
    <query type="node">
      <has-kv k="amenity" v="parking"/>
      <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
    </query>
    <query type="way">
      <has-kv k="amenity" v="parking"/>
      <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
    </query>
    <query type="relation">
      <has-kv k="amenity" v="parking"/>
      <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
    </query>
  </union>
  <!-- print results -->
  <print mode="body"/>
  <recurse type="down"/>
  <print mode="skeleton" order="quadtile"/>
</osm-script>
```
While this worked great, I was interested in getting two different features returned from my query, specifically I wanted to return both parking lots and individual parking spaces.  Parking spaces are rendered currently on the default OSM Mapnik rederer, but their are [accepted tagging practices](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dparking_space) for capturing this information in OSM.  

According to the Overpass API [language guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide), the Overpass API query language supports relative (e.g. non-exact) expressions of locations and names.  Since I'd like the query to return records for both parking lots (amenity=parking) and parking spaces (amenity=parking_space), and the value tag for each starts with the word 'parking,' I wanted to see if I could use a wildcard character which would return both values.  According to the Language Guide for Non-exact names, to create a query which returns all substring values which start with the work 'parking', you change the value variable name ('v') to 'regv', and add an '^' to the query string.  

```

    <query type="node">
      <has-kv k="amenity" regv="^parking"/>
      <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
    </query>
    <query type="way">
      <has-kv k="amenity" regv="^parking"/>
      <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
    </query>
    <query type="relation">
      <has-kv k="amenity" regv="^parking"/>
      <bbox-query {{bbox}}/>
    </query>
  </union>
  <!-- print results -->
  <print mode="body"/>
  <recurse type="down"/>
  <print mode="skeleton" order="quadtile"/>
</osm-script>
```
