Order,Description,Procedure
1,Render Image,Render menu dropdown -> Render Image
2,Change Rendering Engine,open Render menu (upper left of screen) -> Render Image -> Blender Render dropdown -> Cycles Rendere
3,Delete unwanted meshes,"Select object, then press DELETE (or, press X), and confirm deletion"
4,Add a new Plane Mesh,"Shift + A to get the Add pop-up menu, then select Mesh-> Plan"
5,Access (Plane) Object Properties,"Select Object, then Select the orangish-brown cube shaped icon to show the Object (e.g. Plane) properties tab"
6,Align Plane to origin of scene,"Select Object, then click Object Properties Tab -> Transform: Location -> set X=0, Y=0, Z=0"
7,Change Aspect Ratio of plane to match DEM,"Select Object, then click Object Properties Tab -> Transform: Scale -> set X, Y, to a proportion of desired DEM (ex. DEM is 1201 columns, and 1305 rows, set X=1.201 and Y=1.305)"
8,Change from Object Mode to Edit Mode,press TAB
9,Select the Subdivide tool to subdivide the plane into lots of vertices,"Select Object (right-click), change to Edit mode (TAB), locate Subdivide tool in: Tools tab (Left-hand pane) -> Mesh Tools (expand) -> Add: Subdivide"
10,Define the number of vertices to be created by the Subdivide tool (tool can take several minutes to run),expand Subdivide tool -> Number of Cuts -> enter number of cuts (500-2500)
11,Change from Edit Mode back to Object Mode,press TAB
12,Add a Modifier which will deform the surface of the plane based on the input DEM,Object Properties window -> Object Modifiers tab -> Add Modifer dropdown -> Deform column: Displace
13,Add a Texture modifier,Object Properties window -> Object Texture tab -> Add a New Texture -> (Defaults to Type: Clouds)
14,Change Texture modifier from Clouds to Image (aka. DEM),"In Object Texture tab, click [texture] Type: dropdown -> Image or Movie"
15,Set new Image texture to your DEM,"In Object Texture tab, expand the Image group, and click Open.  In the file broswer window which appears, navigate to your DEM, select it, and click Open Image button."
16,"Change Extension property, which determines how edges of plane are dealt with",In Object Texture tab -> expand Image Mapping group -> Extension: dropdown [default is Repeat] -> Extend
17,Change vertical exaggeration Strength property,Object Properties window -> Object Modifier tab -> Strength propery
18,Change plane surface Shading type to Smooth,(with the scene in Object Mode) From the Tools tab (right-hand panel on the screen) -> expand Edit -> Shading: Smooth
19,Set the plane surface Roughness property,Object Properties window -> Object Materials tab -> Roughness: property
20,Align the Camera over the plane,"Select Camera Object, then click Object Properties tab -> Transform: Location -> set X=0, Y=0, Z=3"
21,Change Aspect Ratio of Camera to match Aspect Ratio of DEM,"Select Camera Object, then click Render Properties tab -> expand Dimensions menu -> set Resolution: property, X=1000, Y=1400"
22,Change Resolution Percentage Scale to 100%,"Select Camera Object, then click Render Properties tab -> expand Dimensions menu -> set Percentage Scale for Render Resolution property to 100%"
23,Change the camera lens settings to Orthographic,"Select Camera Object, then click Object Properties tab (Old time video camera icon)-> expand Dimensions menu -> set Percentage Scale for Render Resolution property to 100%"
24,Change the Orthographic scale to be 2x the length of the largest side of the dimensions of the Plane,"Select Camera Object, then click Object Properties tab (Old time video camera icon)-> expand Dimensions menu -> set Orthographic scale to 2.8 (2 x Larger side dimension of plane)"
25,Change the type of Lamp from Point to Sun,"Select the Lamp Object, then click on the Lamp properties tab -> expand Lamp type -> change from Point to Sun"
26,Change the angle of the rays from which the Sun lamp object hits the terrain,"Select the Lamp Object, then click Object Properties tab -> expand Location -> Rotation: (properties) -> X=0, Y=45, Z= 135"
27,Change the Size property of the Lamp to 1,"Select the Lamp Object, then click on the Lamp properties tab -> expand Lamp -> Size: property = 1"
28,Change the Strength property of the Lamp,"Select the Lamp Object, then click on the Lamp properties tab -> expand Nodes -> Use Nodes -> Strength: property = 2"
29,Navigate to renderer Samples property and increase Sampling's Render property,Select the Rederer properties tab -> expand Sampling -> increase Samples: Render = 70
30,"Note that for rendering the final images, a render setting of 150-200 is often used",
31,Change Light Paths property to Limited Global Illumination,"Select the Render properties tab -> expand Light Paths ->  select ""Limited Globall Illumination"" from dropdown menu"
32,Add a Smooth modifier to try to eliminate black patch artifacts,Object Properties window -> Object Modifiers tab -> Add Modifer dropdown -> Deform column: Smooth
33,Increase the smoothing Factor property to 1.5,Object Properties window -> Object Modifiers tab -> Smooth modifier properties -> smooth Factor property = 1.5
34,Increase the smoothing Repeat property to 2,Object Properties window -> Object Modifiers tab -> Smooth modifier properties -> smooth Repeat property = 2
35,"When satisfied with the final rendered image, save the rendered image as a new file",Locate and open the Image menu (lower left corner of screen) -> Save as Image
36,"When the file browser window opens, choose location to save the image to, as well as the type of file, and enter a filename for the output file, then click Save As Image",
