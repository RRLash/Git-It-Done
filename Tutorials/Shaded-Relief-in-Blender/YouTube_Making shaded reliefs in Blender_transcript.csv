Click the Type pulldown menu where the default is currently clouds, and change it to Imager or Movie",14,Change Texture modifier from Clouds to Image (aka. DEM),"In Object Texture tab, click [texture] Type: dropdown -> Image or Movie"
11:55,"To define the location of the image, or in our case DEM, to be used, go down the Texture properties pain to the Image group, and click on the Open file button.  In the file browser window which opens up, navigate to your DEM, then click Open Image in the upper-right corner. The broswer window will close, and the terrain surface will have changed to your DEM",15,Set new Image texture to your DEM,"In Object Texture tab, expand the Image group, and click Open.  In the file broswer window which appears, navigate to your DEM, select it, and click Open Image button."
,"**NOTE NOT IN THE VIDEO** if your image file (TIFF, JPG, PNG) does not conform the requirements states in Part 1, namely that your DEM contains only positive interger values (not floating point values, and that the image file type is either 8-bit, or 16-bits, it will not load.  No error messages are thrown to inform you of this, but you will know becuase the terrain surface will not appear displaced, and will instead be a flat plane again.",,,
12:45,"Once loaded, the raster dimensions and file type can be confirmed under the Source heading under the Texture properties menu. If the DEM file changes (but the file location and name remain the same) the contents of the new file can be loaded into Blender by pressing the refresh button.",,,
12:50,"Need to change the Extension property from the dropdown menu in the Image Mapping group.  The default is Repeat, and it needs to be changed to Extend.  This tells Blender not to repeat (e.g. tile) the displacement along the outer edges of the plane, rather just extend the DEM displacement to the edge of the plane and nothing more.",16,"Change Extension property, which determines how edges of plane are dealt with",In Object Texture tab -> expand Image Mapping group -> Extension: dropdown [default is Repeat] -> Extend
13:50,Changing the vertical exaggeration strength,,,

16:10,Improving the appearance of the raster by changing the type of shading,,,
16:15,"Select the plane object, and under the Object Tools menu on the left-hand side, set the Shading type to Smooth, which eliminates the finely distributed sharp angles of the terrain surface",18,Change plane surface Shading type to Smooth,(with the scene in Object Mode) From the Tools tab (right-hand panel on the screen) -> expand Edit -> Shading: Smooth
16:40,"Blender provides lots of controls about the material which the surface is made of, such as velvet fabric, or metal, or glass.",,,
16:50,"Change the plane's material properties by selecting the Material properties tab in the Object Properties menu, which is a circular icon next to the red-and-white checkerboard icon, which was the Texture property tab.",,,
17:00,"On the Material property tab, you can change the color of the terrain surface and the surface roughness.  To change the color, locate the Color property menu under the Surface group.",,Choose the Color of the plane surface,Object Properties window -> Object Materials tab -> expand Surface -> Color: property
,"**NOTE NOT IN THE VIDEO** if your rendering engine is set to the default of Blender Render, the Material property tab will show different options than what's shown in the video.  To follow along with the tutorial, make sure the Cycles Rederer rendering engine is currently selected.",,,
17:20,"The surface Roughness property controls how glossy or matte the surface appears, base on the way the surfaces reflect light.  Users should play around with this setting to find one that's optimal for their use.  The demo uses 0.7.",19,Set the plane surface Roughness property,Object Properties window -> Object Materials tab -> Roughness: property

4:10,A general rule of thumb is that the Rederer's Resolution property should be less than or equal to the number of subdivisons of the plane,,,
4:50,"If the area of the DEM (which equates to the number of pixels) exceeds the number of subdivisions which the computer hardware can support, then the rendering process needs to be tiled into small manageable pieces which can busequently be mosaiced back together.",,,
5:30,"The ""Percentage scale for render resolution"" impacts the final resolution of the rendered image, so if you want an output render image which matches the X and Y coordinates of the previous Aspect Ratio, then the Percentage needs to be changed to 100%",22,Change Resolution Percentage Scale to 100%,"Select Camera Object, then click Render Properties tab -> expand Dimensions menu -> set Percentage Scale for Render Resolution property to 100%"

2:35,"Understanding what the lamp Rotation property settings mean, and why the location of the lamp in the scene doesn't matter.  The lamp's Rotation property Z-value should always be 135 (from the top-left of the scene), unless there is a good reason to change it, as extensive cartographic research has shown that map users mis-interpret terrain features if lit from other locations than 135.",,,
3:55,"The Y rotation parameter controls essentially how high the Sun is in the sky, or the time of day effect.  Settings close to 0 are essentially vertical (or high-noon), where as 75 is an angle closer to the horizon like at sunrise or sunset, but it's usually kept at 45 unless there is good reason to change it.",,,
5:20,"Additional Lamp settings need to be changed: it's size and strength, which are done in the Lamp properties tab.",,,
