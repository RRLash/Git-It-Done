While their are a vareity of color ramps automatically available in ArcMap, I found that the color range was too broad for the type of thematic map design I have in mind.  Most of the ArcMap ramps cover a range from bright to darkFor my maps, the purpose of including shaded relief data as a base layer is to try to show to the map reader only the major topographic features of an area, for example where major mountain ranges are relative to major deserts.  I plan to layer additional vector data on top of the shaded relief, as well as a fair amount of type.
