### How to do it
This ESRI document explains which buttons to push in ArcMap- [ArcGIS Help 10.1: Working with Color Ramps](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//00s600000013000000)

### Why to do it
While their are a vareity of color ramps automatically available in ArcMap, I found that the color range was too broad for the type of thematic map design I have in mind.  For example, frequently type on a map is shown in black, but if the shaded relief color ramp ranges from black-white, the black areas of the shaded relief can obscure the type or visually distract from other data on the map.  Notice how the country names of Afghanistan and Pakistan (1) are obscured, as well as China (2), and the steep slopes of the Himalyan Mountains create a dark band of black color (3) which is not an important element to this map.

Most of the ArcMap ramps cover a range from bright to darkFor my maps, the purpose of including shaded relief data as a base layer is to try to show to the map reader only the major topographic features of an area, for example where major mountain ranges are relative to major deserts.  I plan to layer additional vector data on top of the shaded relief, as well as a fair amount of type.
