### *MaptimeATL, Hands-on with OpenStreetMap (OSM)*, Monday, June 8, 2015

My name is Ryan Lash.  I make maps at CDC and am a PhD student in the Geography Department at UGA.  Follow me on twitter [@RRLash](https://twitter.com/rrlash)

The goal for tonight is to have everyone *contribute* to OpenStreetMap

You'll need to do the following:   
  - Visit [OSM.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and create an [OpenStreetMap Account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new)
    - Your username will be visible to the public, and will be associated with all of your editing activities
    - Login to your account using a modern browser (*not InternetExplorer)
  - We will begin by learning to map from sattelite imagery using the OpenStreetMap iD Editor

...but first, a bit more about what OpenStreetMap is
  - explore for yourself on (OSM Wiki)[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page]
