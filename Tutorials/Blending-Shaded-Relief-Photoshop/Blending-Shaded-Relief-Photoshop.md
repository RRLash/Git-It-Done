# Blending Shaded Relief with Adobe Photoshop

I just recently realized that Adobe Photoshop is able to do a variety of fairly sophisticated sattelite imagery processing techniques, largely due to to Tom Patterson's excellent [Landsat 8 Photoshop Tutorial](http://www.shadedrelief.com/landsat8/introduction.html).  That tutorial covers: downloaded LandSat8 imagery; creating natural color composites; adding green forests; Adding blue water; pan sharpening with Band 8; and mosaicing multiple image tiles together.
