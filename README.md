Git-It-Done
===========

This is the stuff we are _getting done_ or have **gotten done!**  We work with maps and GIS, and like to use this stuff in public health and international aid and relief.  For us, maps and GIS are incredible tools for helping to get, share, and show people what is going on in the places around us.

I'm new to GitHub, but I think it will help me get more work done, and share this work with others.

Thanks for stopping by (and helping out?).
